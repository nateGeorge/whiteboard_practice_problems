Find the only uncoupled integer in an array.

Problem Statement

Write a program that, given a list of integers as an argument to STDIN

n1, n2, n3, ..
Prints out the only uncoupled (unpaired) integer in the list to STDOUT.

Example 1:

Given the input

1, 2, 3, 1, 2
your program should output:

3
Example 2:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
your program should output:

99
Hints

It is possible to solve this with

Time: O(n) and Space: O(1)
