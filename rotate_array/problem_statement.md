This problem is to rotate a given array to the right by n steps.

For example:

Given [1, 2, 3] and n = 1, you should return [3, 1, 2]

Each step, the last element in the array is moved to the front of the array, and the rest are shifted right.

Another example:

Given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 3, you should return [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
