n factorial (written as n!) is the number we get when we multiply every positive number from 1 up to n together. In this problem, your code will do the grunt work of computing the factorial.

Problem Statement

Write a program that, given a number n from STDIN, prints out the factorial of n to STDOUT:

If n is 0, n factorial is 1
n! is not defined for negative numbers.
Example 1:

3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
So given the input 3, your program should output:

6
